id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: Sounds good, I’m Anders Sandberg and currently I’m a senior research fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford and my academic background is that I first studied mathematics and computer science at Stockholm University in Sweden, as you can hear from my accent that’s where I’m originally from. But I’m one of those unruly students who can’t keep to one topic, so I was studying a little bit of this, a little bit of that. Among everything I got interested in neuroscience, so I started working on neural networks. This was back in the 1990’s, before neural networks actually worked very well, before you could get a 6 figure salary by working with them. And I got out of the field long before it ever happened. But I took classes in neuroscience, psychology and medical engineering and got a PHD in XXX and neuroscience so the mobiles of how memory works in the brain. During that time I was also active in the transhumanism movement and I was one of the organizers of various organizations in the 1990’s. And I was also writing thesis about the ethics and social impact of human enhancement, and that then led to me getting a job here in Oxford because the institute that was starting up in 2006 began with an EU funded project about the ethics of enhancement and once I got here to Oxford I found it was a wonderful place to live and decided to stay here. So that’s kind of my academic background. Now, how did I got interested in cryonics? This has to do with my personal background, I grew up in the 1970’s, in Sweden which was very bold. I read all the science-fiction novels at the local library close to where I lived. I was very interested in the future, futuristic technologies and how to maybe make them real so later I went from the science-fiction section to the physics section and tried to learn all of that. And cryonics of course is a concept that has been around in science fiction for a very long time. I can’t recall the first story where it shows up, it&#x27;s just part of science fiction stories. Sometimes it&#x27;s called “suspended animation”, sometimes “hibernation”. There is a rather vivid depiction of it in Stanislaw Lem’s novel “Fiasco” where early on, in the first chapter, the protagonist, Parvis the space pilot, has an accident and as an emergency measure, his only way to survive is to freeze himself. And then he gets revived later in the next chapter. Maybe it&#x27;s not him, it&#x27;s actually totally unclear both to him and everybody else whether this is actually a different person. So it might be Parvis but it might not be because he’s got memory loss. So that already brought up many interesting issues about personal identity. Of course the main topic of the novel is completely different (...). But basically cryonics has been part of the fictional intellectual milieu for me for a long time. But I knew that there were actual organizations doing it and back in the early 1990’s as I got on to the internet I joined the extropians (type of transhumanism) mailing list. So the Extropy Institute is intellectually an important group. So they were founded by a bunch of futurists around 1989-1990. The main character that is well known is Max More. He was a philosophy student here in Oxford and indeed also for a while head of the students science-fiction society then he founded the Extropy Institute. And for a long while he’s actually been president of Alcor, the life extension foundation, one of the big cryonics organizations, he stepped down from that recently but he’s still involved there. And one of the amazing things was that I had read Edward Regis’ book, “Great mambo chicken and the transhuman condition”, which is a kind of interesting journalistic story about futurist activity in the 1980’s. Suddenly, I was on the same mailing list as these guys, I was kind of “wow, these are the people, people write books about!” And I was on the mailing list, I was really impressed. And then they turned out to be actually quite nice people so I became good friends with quite a lot of them and still am. So at that point, cryonics went from something people did see on movie or TV to “oh there are people on this list who actually literally are standing with ice cubes trying to save somebody’s life” assuming cryonics is saving lives etc. We were having big debates about best methods of suspension and how do you set up organizations that last for a very long time? So this was part of my social environment through out the 90’s although as a student of course I didn’t have a chance to afford cryonics, but once i got a nice stable post here in Oxford, I started thinking “maybe I should get myself a cryonics contract” and in conversations with other academics who agreed, eventually we got over the cryo-crastination and signed up for cryonics. (showing his cryo necklace)</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: What is this?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: This is a medical alert tag, so you’d probably see them quite a lot in other parts of medicine too. My mother for example got one telling doctors what medication she’s on, because she’s on blood thinners so its rather important that they don’t treat her in the wrong way if she ends up in a hospital and the standard ones of course are for hemophilia and epilepsy. This one tells that if the patient is dead, call this number, cool the body with ice, inject 55 units of heparin, keep the pH of the blood in this range and give CPR (réanimation cardiopulmonaire). Which are weird instructions but basically instructions to start the cryo-suspension protocole. This would actually work if I were to be killed right now and end up at the local hospital, it&#x27;s of course debatable. Quite a lot of people wear things like this but it actually doesn’t make sense. The best way of making any cryonics suspension work is actually talk to your doctor and explain what you want, why you want it and how it’s supposed to work.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Léa: Which cryonics organization did you choose?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: I went with Alcor, that’s partially because I know the people involved with Alcor, so I trust them and I think they have the best science. They are slightly pricier I think than Cryonics Institute but I think the important thing is that it’s a good organization.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: You said you signed for this with other colleagues, was it all linked to the extropian institute?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: No they were colleagues with me in Oxford, so basically there is this funny story. I had this discussion about cryonics and the rationality of doing it with a colleague. This was just before Christmas at a local pizza place and then I realized we actually had a very similar conversation exactly one year ago, because it was also Christmas and also at this pizza place. So we were kind of amused and then we realized “ok, we both thought it was smart to sign up for cryonics and we still haven’t done it. Has anything changed in the year in between? And there was this rumor that Paris Hilton had signed up for cryonics. At that moment there was this silence between the 2 Oxford academics who realized “maybe Paris Hilton is smarter than us”. So then we decided “let&#x27;s actually sign up”.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: Is it easy to sign up for cryonics? What is the process? </div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: It’s slightly bureaucratic. So what I needed to do was to contact Alcor and they sent over a packet of forms and part of that is the ethical aspect of informed consent. You need to explain to people what they are getting into and be honest about what you can and cannot do. And then, there is of course the American legal system, you also want people to sign off “yes I have read this, and I do understand this”. So fill out these forms, you send them back. Some weeks later, another packet of forms shows up and this goes back and forth a few times. It takes a while. The final set of forms need to be signed by witnesses, with a notorious public… Because it needs to be adapted to American lawyers. Because America is great when it comes to sueing you. So the great question is how do you pay for this? It’s not super cheap. There is a real problem: if I’m dead I’m really bad at paying for something so the solution is to have life policy insurance and this life policy insurance is given to the company when I die, and that pays for the suspension. There are some complications in the UK because companies can’t hold life insurance policies on people here so we had to set up a foundation in the UK that is jointly run by the company and by me, that owns the life insurance so then I’m paying every month for the life insurance. That way it can pay for my suspension.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: The foundation is also a way to promote cryonics in the UK?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: No this is just for the legal problem of how you can pay out. Alcor used to have a branch in the UK in the late 1990’s but it did not work for a bunch of legal and economic reasons. There is cryonics UK, a legal organization promoting cryonics. But they have fairly limited resources. I think the image we have doesn’t work that well because people are far away from organizations. That does not work very well. The solution is to, if you know you are dying, move to a cryonics institute in wait for your cryopreservation. In my case it might be that I get a ticket to Scottsdale, Arizona! Watching Republicans play golf… </div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: We heard about the case of a young girl in the UK getting cryonics. How did the network of cryonics work?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: Cryonics is mainly done by people who believe in cryonics for idealistic reasons. Cryonics is not a stable medical treatment. Indeed most people in medicine may not have heard of it or that it doesn’t work. So a lot of people involved in cryonics are doing it as a voluntary activity. This is what the UK organization for cryonics does. When the case of the teenager happened I was the local expert so I literally spent the day at the BBC studio in Oxford, moving from TV and radio. It was an interesting case because of the disagreement between the parents on whether or not she should be allowed to have a suspension. When she finally died the cryonics suspension institute had some delay and I talked with some lawyers and we all agreed that it would be good for cryonics if it was more of a professional organization. One of the interesting things is that we are getting the first European cryonics institute, there is the European biostasis foundation that is going to be set up in Zurich. It looks pretty promising. </div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Léa: There is the Tomorrow biostasis with 150 members approximately but haven’t started preserving anyone yet.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: You have to demonstrate you have the logistics. Who wants to be the first patient? Perfusion is not easy and doing it well needs a lot of training. The patients are in a cooled state. You need logistics, a good source of liquid nitrogen. There are a lot of very practical things. It is another thing being a futurist thinking about how to fix people with cryonics, how to wake them up. I may consider switching my contract to the European Biostasis Organization simply because it is closer. </div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Léa: Talking about new cryonics organizations, have you heard of Southern Cryonics in Australia. I don’t know if they are going to happen. It would be the 6th organization. </div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: There is also some organization in the North West l the USA, one in Oregon … I don’t know what its status is right now. Robert McIntyre in charge of it is very exuberant, they want to use fixation methods to see that the brain is well preserved.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Léa: Oh you are talking about Nectome? Do you think it is a cryonics institute?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: I don’t know but maybe they are related. Not a cryonics organization but they use similar methods, you would have to cool out the brain but there is a fundamentally philosophical difference. You had debates at the Alcor 40 years conference. I got this beautiful thought of Leonardo’s last supper where you had a cryonicist arguing with a ? as they call them (20’39) It was hilarious. </div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: And about this: where does cryonics stand in the field of transhumanism?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: I usually define transhumanism as the human body can be technologically improved. And that it is a good idea. You can go back very far .. Benjamin Franklin was joking about staying in a jar to be restored in the future to see how the US has evolved. But the conversation had started. Can we improve our brains? Life enhancement is an important part of that. our lifespans are something very important. We call them human mortals. Immortality is something you may not get in cryonics. In the 1960’s they were explicitly transhumanist … It is basically tracing the group of futurists. People are interested in inner space. There have always been crosslites. Timothy Leary who was kind of a prophet of the LSD years in the 1960’s and 1970’s in the latter years his motto was space migration, intelligence increase and body conservation. A lot of transhumanists refused to deal with that stuff – the use of drugs to achieve all this. Some people in transhumanism were working on computers. Others were interested in technologies. Cryonics is a form of organization where even if you are not a doctor you might be useful to help carry things around. Many of these organizations were important networks of transhumanists. In the 1990’s, transhumanism became more known because of the Internet. Later we started building transhumanist associations … But cryonics has always been tight to it. I have a transhumanist friend that is persuaded that cryonics does not work. Other people think that nano-technology is working so fast that they don’t need cryonics – which is in my opinion stupid. My own view is that cryonics has a small chance of working but it might be that other people don’t find it rationale. Why should I care if there is an Anders in the future if he is different? A philosopher told me why should you care with cryonics while with that money you could save a lot of Africans too. How do you motivate this ethical aspect?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: How do you justify it with the environmental question …</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: I think it is not a problem, it is not a different process that what you usually do at the hospital, then you use liquid nitrogen which is a by-product of much of the industry, plus there are not a lot of people doing it, so that is not much of a problem. There is a fear that the future may be overpopulated with cryonics patients. Well so far not that many people have signed up. And I think that cryonics is going to keep being a niche right to the point where people are going to show an actual demonstration. At which point a lot of people will be full of regrets and will ask to use cryonics. But why should I care for a future Anders? It might not be perfect. To some extent there is a selfish thing – I want to continue my life. I’m a very cheerful person, it is enjoyable to be me. This is a way of guaranteeing that. I also have knowledge that might be useful in the future even though waking up in hundreds of years this knowledge might be obsolete. But there is history knowledge, I think it is very interesting to have witnesses around. We need that increasingly. I have been kind of fascinated with the reactions regarding the invasion of Ukraine because as somebody living in the 80’s and 90’s I remember the Cold War, I remember the missiles, … Many people&#x27;s reaction is that they have never been through this and maybe I could say something about that that may be useful. Generally I think people would say cryonics is a big problem because it takes many resources and we could use it for other medical treatments. First of all, of course we assume that you are running it on the public healthcare system which is not the case right now. Even if it was, when you look at the cost of healthcare, both for money and resources, in terms of time for doctors, what is costful is the end of someone’s life. And if instead of spending a lot of time and paying on these last few weeks trying to do things that are mostly going to fail instead you do a cryonic suspension you might save them. Indeed it might be a saving. I’m afraid people will start freezing people even if they don’t have to!</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: Do you have many meetings to talk about cryonics?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: I have written articles on the ethics of cryonics. I’m involved in the community but not as much as I could be.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Léa: How is … If somehow we will be able to wake you up in the future, how will you consider your life since you will probably not know anybody at the moment and they won’t be able to make you live as you live now. Maybe you will have some … capacities that you don’t have … How do you consider it? </div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: This is the great fear of people when they talk about cryonics. There is always the argument that you come up in a dystopian world. My answer is being a cryon is being a time refugee. It is actually similar to being a refugee from a location to another. We might lose all social connections and end up in a society where they don’t understand or might not even want them. I regard cryonics as being a temporary refugee. I’d rather go into the future by not … by people solving the problem of fixing and then life extension and so on. But if necessary, if I found my country is dangerous I would like to go somewhere safier. There is also another aspect of this. Why do they assume no one from our social network is going to be around? Normally it is a good guess because few people sign up for cryonics. If it is a random chance you have few chances. But of course you can sign up with your family. Indeed it is not unusual for people from the same family, living together or so to have similar outlets. Now I haven’t convinced my husband to sign up for cryonics yet but it might happen relatively soonish. A fun thing is that when we got married the priest saw this (he shows his necklace) and my husband who is a lawyer said legally a marriage ends when one of the two dies but I’m willing to give you a second chance … So you have to make sure that your friends and family also sign up! Then also you might also want to have friends and family that care about you. So in the future they or their descendants will like to have their fun uncle back. My brother’s kids are going to remember me as a very fun uncle.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: And also if people are getting cryonics, you meet new people, you are in contact with persons that could wake up at the same time as you! </div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: So that is one of the interesting things because these people know they are going to be very nice because you know in this community that you could wake up together.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: How involved do you get in the cryonics process? Do you suggest Alcor use new products?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: As a theoretical guy I’m happy to leave this to people in the lab. I’m more on the theory side. Also when people talk about nanotechnology how do you use it for cryonics? Generally I’m more on the theory side because I think cryonics has an image problem, not widely accepted, many people think it is weird or science fiction, and many people do have ethical objections. I think most of them are bad ethical objections. It is a little bit like arguments against life extension. They would never do it. No ethicist would say we should stop research on cancer to diminish life extension because life is boring! When you deal with life extension, many people feel this threat. People are using bad arguments and my job is to point out what works and what doesn’t. I showed many arguments we have against assisted dying are arguments for cryopreservation of bodies. Which is great fun to write. There are ethical points that are very interesting like how much of your life it is good to gamble. If I believe my life could be very good in a super civilization, why shouldn&#x27;t I freeze myself now even if it has a small probability of working. That low probability seems to have a big payoff. So I call the exuberant transhumanist problem because it seems irrational. Gambling on your life years seems to be irrational but it is very interesting with the law of probability, the sphere of probability.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Léa: It raises a question. I read something about someone saying he would prefer to be cryopreserved alive but it is not possible. Is it something we should hope for?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: I think we are approaching that. I think it is going to take a lot of time to allow assisted dying and at that point it may be combined with cryopreservation. The problem here is the cryonics movement would love doing this but they don’t have the credibility. It is better to have doctors and families by their side and then as the law and practices will change they could do cryonics this way. Now the problem is many people could not wait. There has been an interesting case at least in America where people tried to get the suspension before being legally dead and they did not allow it. But that was back in the 1980&#x27;s when the rules were stricter. There is nowadays at least one case where cryonics was combined with an assistant dying. It is not that the person died because of cryopreservation but they moved the corpse quickly after.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Léa: Do you have the name of this case?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: No, not in my brain. There was a little bit of writing about it, maybe on Alcor’s website.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: About the thawing of the body do you know if it is a topic talked about at Alcor?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: If I remember right, Alcor has a bit of a research side but it is relatively small and then they have organizations like 21CM that are doing lab research for the cryonics community and they are doing much more. I don’t really know the organization landscape. I know much more research is needed but I know so far the cryonics movement has done the practical thing of freeing people. But there has been little research and it would gain credibility with more research. But it is an egg and chicken issue. I think there is a need to do a lot of research in this field. The cryobiology field is scared that they may be associated with cryonics. I’m mostly thinking of fixating brains, Hayworth’s style, as I work in neuroscience.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: And do you intend to cryopreserve your whole body?</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: No, just the head.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: I think it is because you work in neuroscience, the head is the most important thing to protect … </div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: Yeah and the body is certainly important to protect. It certainly has interesting interactions between the brain and the body, but it is the only way I could get abs. Going to the gym is way more science fiction than me walking with a cyber body.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: There is not much research done in this field. Because you are an academic, maybe you can explain to us more why cryonics is not a topic that is more written on and even for you because we heard you talk about it and we know you want to be cryopreserved, you could only write about it more.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: Yeah I don’t write that many articles. You can do more writing but the problem is that I’m interested in so many things I can’t work on everything. The problem is why people think cryonics is bonkers. The reason is we don’t know if it can work. In science we do a hypothesis, we do an experiment, we go back and analize. There is a routine of how we develop new ideas. In cryonics we are doing a new treatment, people say it is different. We don’t know what the chances are, it is about what is going to be developed in the future. This is different from what is normally done in medicine. I think it is a valid form of experimentation. Many people in medicine hate doing things that are not evidence based. There is a network that tries to do experiments. Reviving some cells or showing that there is no damage using some cryoprotectants doesn&#x27;t mean the whole system can work! I’m only going to show a small piece that goes in that direction. And I may amass many small bits that go into that direction. But it is still going to be … That’s why we need to have different approaches. Kenneth Hayworth and the Nectome people have focused on demonstrating we could preserve micro-structures. You can do testable experiments there. And many scientists can work on brain scan, organ transplants and cryopreservation of organs. In the UK I found out that when some kids get cancer it is really bad for their cells, they take eggs and testicular tissues before doing the treatment. In one case they re-transplanted an egg so that a person could get a kid. They took the sample thinking that in the future they will find a way to implement it. It shows that scientists are also accepting this logic.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: It is also what we are interested in with this topic: how can you apply a science of some parts to the all body. Maybe one last cancer, what would you say to someone skeptical about cryonics? Or even someone calling it pseudoscience.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Anders Sandberg: I think it is not good to call it pseudo science. A pseudoscience is something that pretends to be scientific but isn’t so you might have homeopathy where people claim they have a theory but when they try to prove it it is clear it isn’t working.But they still persist. The fringe science is the science that is not accepted by the scientific community but when we get more information it tends to become pseudoscience because people refuse to call it science or it actually turns out to be science. For example the idea of meteorites as rocks falling from the sky was fringe science for a long while until you had evidence saying minerals and rocks were found. The problem is the many practices that are in between there. For example organ transplant was not fringe medicine but was very strange, suspect medicine and indeed many of the early attempts did not work. Gradually it became a practice. So I would argue that cryonics today is a fringe science wanting to prove it can become a real science. It has various parts that are not fringe science. It is just that all edifice is not fringe science. I Think that is fine. The cryo needs to prove itself. Yesterday I was looking at a physics theory. This is the best fringe physics I have read in a long time but I don’t believe it. How much effort society puts in is going to be valuable? I think it is rational for me to sign up for cryonics. It may not be rational for you. It depends on your view of the probability of it working, the value of your life, what you would like to do with the money … Different people will come to different conclusions. </div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Matéo: Thank you very much for your time.</div><div class="content-p " id="7870343c-97ba-45f2-ae39-26633dac91d5">Léa: Thank you.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="notes-container"></div></div></div></section></div>
