Matéo, Nils Hoppe ; 1 heure 8’ 21’’, le 9/03/22, via Zoom</div><div class="wrapper-block conteneur3" tags="conteneur3"><div class="wrapper-block paragraphe" tags="paragraphe"><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : So maybe to start you could introduce yourself.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe: Okay so my name is Nils Hoppe, I’m a professor of law and ethics of sciences at the University of Hannover, I’m lawyer by training so I originally did my undergraduate law degree in England. And then I’m German but did my undergraduate in England and then worked as a lawyer here in England for a while in medical law and then I returned to Germany and I became an in-house consolar so an internal lawyer for the university hospital which was very boring, lots of contracts, lots of … and always the same questions [45 seconds - 1 minute 13] I thought at the time I wanted something very interesting, I wanted to answer new questions and the practice of law couldn’t do that so I became a research fellow for ethics in medicine and I became interested with that interface between hard rules in terms of law and moral questions. So the question of what happens when something is legal or not but morally problematic which is at large a sociological question rather than a philosophical or legal question. So how does society respond to conflicting norms and what do conflicting norms mean for our endeavor to build a society that we actually want to live in and live in together? When I started as a research fellow in medical ethics I was looking for a topic to do my PHD on and I took a theme that I saw when I was working as an in-house consolar at the university hospital and that is the question who owns biomaterials so what happens if you take a blood sample or a sperm sample or other sample from the human body and make it into a commodity? Into a thing that can be taken from one place to another and traded and sold and lent to people and so on. And it turns out that there is not really a good answer to that because it is a particular kind of thing, it is not something you move from A to B, it contains something very intimate and private, genetic information, health information [2’45 - 3’00] I came to the point where the law and medical ethics and bioethics are not very good at regulating surprises. But it is the business of science to produce surprises, new entities, new ideas, new sets and how do we respond in a normative sense to this? The answer is: very poorly. And that is what I developed into my research focus. So it started with property rights over the human body and to biomaterials and now in general the question how does the law and how does a normative framework respond to surprises that science generates? It’s so I am working on xeno-(?) transplantation for example, I’m working on … (3’42?) animals so when you do human animal mixtures to produce transplants … These are special entities, they are not quite humans, they are not quite animals, they are somewhere in between. It is a new kind of category so how do we deal with that? Our completely new vaccines for example that use completely new technologies. It’s the new entities and how do we regulate them. That is also one of the reasons why I got involved in that question of cryonics at the time.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : Yeah because how do you think it is going … maybe to start … What are the main societal questions? Because that is what we are talking about in society … how it may change society in the near future when you said that there is this progression of cryonics so it raises ethical, legal and societal questions. What questions do you see? </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : I think the fundamental question right now is what kind of position we want to take in front of a technology that doesn’t exist yet? We want to take the position that as long as there is not an existing functional technology we shouldn’t promise it to people, we should wait until it is proven or should we open the door to say to people what you are doing if you are preserving opportunities and that can’t be a bad thing. So we have to get beyond that very first threshold. So one of the first criticisms we had in the cryonics case and I think you’ve probably read that if you are aware of the case that was behind all of that, the young girl … </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : Yeah the case of the young teenage girl.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Yeah JS. Which was a very sad case. In many ways and at the end as well. It didn’t go that well according to the plan at the end and it was all hesitant and improvised and that feeds that initial skepticism that we have in our society which says in a sense you are selling people a service that you can’t deliver with more question marks than answers in this. It’s a limited company that does this. What happens if that company runs out of funds? How do you explain that sometimes only the head is cryopreserved? What if you need to store something for 300 years before the time comes? How do you guarantee that the money …? The question marks there are significant and the baseline that we have in our society is that if you try to find analogies in other areas of life in selling people something that you can’t yet deliver on or very quickly in an area where you say this isn’t serious. You are actually taking people’s money for something you can’t yet deliver and you might be very close to a fraud. This is the kind of … At the same time, having put aside the “it will never happen” speech and it’s an immoral thing … And you are addressing people that are vulnerable. More often than not. People who have to decide this for people in a situation of vulnerability. Like JS in this case. You knew she was going to die. She was in a death-life situation and time is running out. Dealing with a specific time of clientèle that has to take decisions under due rest. It is interesting when you talk to people who can think about all these things free from stress. [7’45 - 9’00 : A very famous scientist who is a transhumanist has a plaque saying “I want to be cryopreserved, here is what to do” and he carries it around with him]. But there are also people who are not in a vulnerable situation, those who argue that this is interesting and exciting because these arguments do not come out of a situation of vulnerability. So that is also … </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : Yeah, not a person dying or … </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Yeah and then when we talk about the different perspectives on this we get into an interesting territory because from the law perspective and that is how the JS case was thought about you have a legal perspective: why should we not allow people to use these things if they freely come to the conclusion that they are perfectly happy to accept the risk that this may never work? They are happy to spend tens of thousands of euros on a technology that simply might never work and they fully understand and accept that it is the case and they want to preserve that miniscule chance and they are willing to pay these prices. There is nothing in our legal mature system that can stop them from doing so! And so this contractual autonomy that we all have to enter a very stupid agreement, that should also be the case here … it is just a question of vulnerabilty that we have to keep an eye on: who is agreeing to these agreements and are they able to take this type of decision free or not? But that is not different from decision making in medicine in general. That is not new, there is nothing novel here. We’ve always had vulnerable people making life or death decisions in medicine. So that should not really surprise us. We shouldn’t really fear that. </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : For instance … like when for example?</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Yeah so the classic example used to be Jehova’s witnesses who were offered blood transfusions and for religious reasons rejected the blood transfusions, which is the trivial thing, right? Some refused this perfusion fully understanding that that would mean death. And for a lot of people who are let’s say more secular, slightly more clinging in terms of their life more than their religions, that must seem like an irrational solution. So the balancing exercise would be very different for someone who thinks that religious views shouldn&#x27;t trump your life. [11’45-12’00] As long as we are satisfied that they take these decisions in an informed way and not out of a situation of exploitation for example and then we must accept that choice, we must accept it. In medicine it is for example body dysmorphia, where people say I know I am going to be much happier if I only have one leg and they are asking for an amputation, the vast majority of people would say that is irrational. But there must be a point where a mature legal system and a mature society recognizes that in order for people to have a good life, a happy life they must also take decisions that other people consider to be irrational. </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Léa : So it raises a question about the different countries because there are different countries where it is possible like the US and others where it is not possible like France. Do you know what the difference is between the US and the French law for example … or I don’t know what Germany is? What makes it possible in the US and impossible in France? </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Unfortunately I can’t help you with the French law, I’m not a French lawyer but it has come as a difference between the permissive legal system and less permissive legal systems is a really trivial one. It is the actual view of cryopreservation. Because the jurisdictions that I know of and France would be probably similar: cryopreservation is a mode of funeral, it is the disposition of the body after death. So if you have a legal system that says for instance for legal reasons of public health of the protection from infections and the protection of the dignity of the diseased person we require you to do only a very limited number of things with the body after death so you get your different possession of the body as a relative and you were told you know have ten days or eight days to bury the body and here are your three options. You can incinerate the body, you can bury it in the ground but not anywhere. You can’t put it in your garden. It has to be in a cemetery somewhere or you can do something else but there is a limited number of things. You can donate the body for science for example but then even after the body was used for science there is usually a funeral. So the ending point is usually the same. Or you have very permissive libertarian jurisdictions like in many states in the US where if you want to bury your father in the front garden, then we must permit that. So as long as the body is dealt with in some sort of way that assures the body is no danger to society you can do whatever you want with it. And that includes cryopreservation because for those it is only a mode of burial. The person ceases to be a person, they stop being an agent, they stop being a citizen as far as the law is concerned, these people have died and they&#x27;re just buried and they are in a very fanciful and strange way in a tank with very low temperatures and that is basically a tumb. Legally speaking. And I think this is the only difference we have here. The only additional argument you might have is a public interest in preventing contracts that bind relatives after death for a subject matter that they have no control over. </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : Okay yeah so after for the generations inheriting the cryopreserved in a way. </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Yeah so it might be that if I say I want to be cryopreserved, I’ll get a contract that automatically binds my estate for the people that will have my heritage after my death then basically give into an obligation that I entered into. And it might be difficult in a civil law sense in some countries … </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : And so because it is this question of the legal future of cryonics and you said that in 10 years maybe cryonics will make a huge progression but what measures should be taken nowadays not to foresee the future but to try to adapt to what you were talking about in the beginning meaning that the science isn’t predictable and we need to frame it.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : That is a really good question because in a way there is no good answer to this. So let’s deal with two possible scenarios. Scenario 1 is the one we have talked about before and it is that it isn’t going to work. And everybody who goes into cryopreservation now is going to be a problem for someone at some point because they have to deal with the bodies. And there are many bodies and the money runs out. I don&#x27;t know if the company will go bankrupt. I don’t know if there is some risk that this happens and they have a warehouse full of bodies and heads. That is the first scenario where it is not going to work. Scenario number 2, let’s say in 10 or 15 years or 20 years it is possible, just fictionally right?, it is possible not to put that head on another body or to wake someone up and give him a quick treatment to chimio to bring them back to life and make them healthy again but maybe it is possible to download their consciousness into a system and give them the opportunity to experience consciousness again without a body … for arguments’ sake let’s say this is possible. It also creates an almost insurmountable legal problem and that is because these people have died. They’ve stopped being in existence, their property was distributed, they stopped getting the rights … and suddenly, your warehouse turns from a storage facility for dead persons which might be permissible where you are into a hospital full of people. But you suddenly have a warehouse full of individuals who are agents who have rights whose rights need to be protected and actualised and you are just a small company storing people’s head but now you are no longer that, you are actually the custodian of people, you are running a prison and the … in my mind the legal and moral problems that suddenly pop into existence, that weren’t there before because these people turn from ex-persons to persons one day to the next. What if the technology is available to give these people consciousness again and bring them back to life but you haven’t got the resources to do so as a company? But you have an obligation to do so because you promised it! What happens then?</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : Yeah yeah they are bound to do whatever it takes to bring them back to life.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Yeah … so you are suddenly legally speaking and maybe morally speaking no different from someone who has snatched someone in the street and kept him prisoner in the basement. (20’00 - 20’20) The answer to your question is how do we prepare for these scenarios, the answer is I have no idea! A legal answer would be to use the precautionary principle in technologies. The precautionary principle tells us that if we don’t know the risks, if we can’t manage the risks, if the risks potentially massively outweigh the benefits of the exercise then we must prohibit the exercise. And that would mean no cryonics, at least until we know how it works, how it fully works. There is a technology, a sociologist, Colin Ridge in the 1980’s, it is something called the Colin Ridge dilemma. (21’00 - 21’40). It is a well known dilemma in technology. When there is a new technology that comes along and you have no idea how it is going to work out and, because you have no idea how it is going to work out, you don’t have regulatory tools in order to regulate it adequately. In the time you know how it works out because it has worked out in some way it is too late to regulate it because it is too late already. And one of the only responses that answers the Colin Ridge dilemma is a prohibitive one. It’s to say if you have a very novel technology and if you really don’t know the risks and you are reasonably sure the risks are going to be pretty massive, for example the genetic modification of crops and livestocks where you don’t know what happens when it goes out into the wild then the only adequate response is to prohibit it and to certainly allow a small dose to allow certain partial aspects until you understand it adequately to regulate it properly. And for cryopreservation that would in all likelihood mean we will have to progress the technology much much further before we start freezing people.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : And also a question of time, if you stop the activity you stop the research so there is a true dilemma.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Yeah but again what is important from an ethics or legal point of view? It is always important to ask yourselves is this a new challenge? Or is that the kind of challenge that we have already and that we already have developed tools for it. When many were not talking about the experimental part of it we should encourage experimentation and innovation and so we should make it possible for projects, trials, experiments by all means and we might open the door to certain contexts in which even a non-experimental use of cryopreservation is sensible : think about space travel or soldiers injured at war … if you develop technologies for these contexts, fine, but we have to separate that from the translation into the clinic. In medicine and biotechnology we already have this distinction between experimental and clinical and clinical means it is for an everyday use and it is available for everyone. It is that bit that I’m concerned about. I’m not concerned about the experimental bit. By all means let’s try everything thanks to experimentation. I’m all for that because otherwise we won’t have innovation we won’t progress but it is far too soon to make this into a product. I can’t think of an analogy with technology in the last 200 years. Something so unfinished was sold to individuals as a finished product.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : So the clinical part of cryonics is a bit on the rise. It is a topic becoming more and more important. Today you stand for a ban for a clinical use of cryopreservation but an experimental use if I understand well?</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Yes, in fact I find it hard to say finally I’m in favor of a ban or something. I am cautious and I am not convinced that it is legally and morally justifiable to create a medical product that can’t yet deliver on its promise. And sell that to any consumers. I think this is widely unusual. It probably needs to be regulated more but I’m in favor of experimentation but I’m also in favor of communicating to the public much more directly about the current state of experimentation. For instance 10 years ago, people wanting an in vitro procreation were told it is much better to freeze sperm and embryos than it is to freeze an egg! And the reason why eggs were not frozen 10 or 15 years ago is because human eggs have a lot of water in it. So cryopreservation research from 2005, to 2006 said that if we defrost an egg cell that is so large you get ice crystals that form and that actually damage the cell. So cryopreservation research 15 or 10 years ago was still struggling to cryopreserve and then defrost large cells with a lot of water in it. That is where the research was. It’s better now, we made progress concerning if we freeze over more cells … but that took a long time and that was a time when we already were selling products to people where they could pick to cryopreserve the entire body or the entire head using the same technology than in IVF were you were saying we can’t do large cells because we have no guarantee that it will work. There is a discrepancy between the actual cryopreservation research that was being used successfully in IVF and the product that was being sold to individuals. I find this problematic.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : What is the state of cryonics in Germany? And maybe to talk about transhumanism more generally to see where cryonics lead and stand. Cause you mentioned <a href="mailto:anders.sandberg@philosophy.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank" id="contextualization-3dc19826-cbdd-4583-92b1-ec57932d67d7" class="contextualization inline webpage content-a" alt="href" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-tip="mailto:anders.sandberg@philosophy.ox.ac.uk (mailto:anders.sandberg@philosophy.ox.ac.uk)"><u>Anders Sandberg</u></span></a> … </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">N: A little bit when I talk about human enhancement and attend talks on transhumanism. Let me answer the first question. My position is that cryopreservation would not be allowed in Germany. There is a company in Berlin that is selling this. But I don’t know if they have many clients yet. They can promise whatever you like as long as you get involved with the contracts, they don’t have a legal problem technically.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Léa : Sorry to interrupt but are you talking about Tomorrow Biostasis? It looks very modern, I was quite impressed. I think it is the only one in the cryopreservation world that makes it very nice. They did a good job to attract people but then, yeah, I don’t know if they have cryons … </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Yeah I think that’s the one I talked with, I can’t remember the name but I had a short exchange with them on Twitter where I asked them “I’m really interested guys, what is your legal basis for this?” And they responded something like “Yes there’s a legal basis” And so what is it? (laughs) </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : They wouldn’t tell you.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : And they said “If you have any questions, get in touch with us”. Well I’m getting in touch with you, what’s your legal basis? I wonder why they’re doing this and I don’t know this for sure … My suspicion is the only loophole they could use to make this work in Germany is to make this part of donating your body for science. So essentially they’re running their company like a massive clinical trial for cryopreservation and in order to do that you need to have doctors on board, you need to have certain … fulfill certain requirements if you are basically registering as a research institution, but then that as a loophole that might actually work but that makes it, it makes it commercially interesting how they separate the payment for the services from the donation aspect of the body. I am almost certain that it is not lawful in Germany to pay someone else to do research on your body after your death, because that would be an awful modification of the body. But I don’t know enough about the business model to actually understand what they do and I’ve asked them and they’ve not been very helpful. A long time ago, I did a project on 23 and me. Are you familiar with 23 and me?</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : No.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : It’s a company that offers DNA testing. And you can basically track your DNA, check it out and get all sorts of insights on your DNA. </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : It’s not the thing with the ancestors and … where you are from, etc.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Yeah, ancestries and traits and you know do you have any problems with the biomarkers for disease (?, 31’57) and parkinsons and I was interested in how they do with my material. Who owns the material? What happens to the material? Do they commercialize the material? And I got in touch with them at the time I said well how do you do this? What is your legal basis for … you know, I’m interested in this (laughs) and you don’t get a response, so at the time I basically did the experimentation by sending my materials to them and then they sent me all the contracts about all the internal documents that basically told me how they will handle my material. Only that way could I find out … </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : What was the legal basis, yeah.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Yeah so here I’d have to do something similar, I’d have to get in touch with Tomorrow Biostasis and say I’m interested, I want to be a customer and it feels a bit like being a private detective and that was kind of exciting. I’m not sure it’s a good way to do scholarship and academic work but … </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Léa : From what I found, looking at the website, it’s not like Alcor in the USA where you would give a big amount of money one time, it’s more like an insurance thing … Talking about the business model, it’s like they were talking about giving 20 euros per month, something like that while you are still alive of course. And … and then maybe it kind of transforms the way we see and pay for cryopreservation, maybe more like a life insurance thing or I don’t know.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Yeah this is an interesting analogy for this and I’m grateful you mentioned that actually. Think of “Dignitas” for example in Switzerland. Think of entities organizations that help people, assist people with their death at the end of their lives. They use a similar business model in the sense they don’t say okay we are going to be there and we are going to help you kill yourself, that’s 50,000 dollars please. They want you to be a member while you are still alive. And you become a member of the organization and you pay a monthly fee for them and then when your time comes they are available for you. But that’s … there is no difference here, they’re just asking for the payment upfront for the services delivered. but obviously that makes it easier so you can basically say you are paying a membership for you to be part of an organization and you are not actually distinctly getting a service of cryopreservation for it but if you are supporting our aims and our research, you could even dress it up very nice by saying it is a solidarity basis so the guys who are still alives, and who are members of this organization pay for the upkeep of those you are cryopreserved. So the cryopreservation is technically free because it is paid for by the members who are still alive but all you are doing is shifting the point of payment. So that’s the only difference. But that&#x27;s just one model for generating income without generating legal problems. At the same time, there is just not going to be enough, the research organization and these bodies are provided to you for research purposes. So in a way you are using a loophole. Which is probably … I don’t know if it’s morally problematic. it’s not legally problematic to use a loophole unless you can prove they are not really doing research. And you probably can’t because in all likelihood what they want to do is they want to understand better how cryopreservation works, so they are doing research. They are looking for daily metrics of each of the tanks, they are trying to prove the efficiency of the tanks. I am sure they are generating all sources of data that are interesting for research. But they are getting this from people who are essentially paying to be part of the research. But hum your second question was on where does this encounter with transhumanism?</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : Yeah yeah. </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Maybe that sort of goes with something that is there from the start and that is the preservation of opportunities. So a lot of transhumanists don&#x27;t just look at the now. And sort of ask what can I do to myself and make me a better human to improve on the human condition the way I’m born and make me into something post-human. It also looks like how can I extend the time that I have for all of this. All of this transhumanism and posthumanism isn’t particularly interesting if I only have 85 years to do it. Right?</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : For posthumanism sorry, posthumanism is?</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : It is when you achieve your goal of becoming something that is so much better than humans that you are a post human. I’d say one aspect of expanding the time you have to achieve this goal is technologies that aim at longevity, living longer. Living forever ideally, you only are a posthuman if you live forever right? And I mean you immediately start seeing the problem of that, right? Everyone lives forever and either we stop birthing people and then we just have a society of absolutely massively old people which would be really boring (laughs) and probably dangerous because it is always old men that start wars (laughs) I mean from a philosophical point of view, we want to live in the best of all possible worlds right? And a society of old people doesn’t really work from a sense of that being a really good world. That’s the first thing. I think we need more young people, less old people really hum but the other thing as well is who gets it? Right? This is the fundamental ethical problem that you have in all sorts of technologies, we had it in organ transplantation, we had it in human enhancement, we had it in chemical enhancement, you know, but not for everyone. For those who can afford it, right? For those who can afford to take it and to control it you know we are creating another layer within society that separates us from each other. The guys who have the best prosthesis, who can run the fastest, they are not going to live in a favela or so. There are going to be guys who live in the nicest part of Paris, London or Los Angeles or Berlin. The people who buy organs are not poor people. So we already have this problem in other areas of biotechnologies and medicine. And creating a society where those who can afford it can live longer can live forever can preserve themselves so they become agents at a later point in time. They’re not going to be people from the global population. It’s going to be the same old people, literally, the same old people who always hold all the cards in our society.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : And so you have this ethical problem related to the price of cryonics which is a main issue, and who can access it like … but the thing we see is that the price is maybe not a strong barrier or a strong … something that pushes poor people from doing it, life insurances or stuff like this. And this is for the ethical part. Is this really unethical? And also on the climate point that you briefly mentioned,  when you said we’d have to stop birthing, how the Cryonics Institute … puts itself and … how does it build itself in a melting world?</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : First of all, cryonics technologies have a certain elegance. Right? They were developed in order to help create life when otherwise life would not have been possible without these technologies and now that is being well established but it also happens at the end of life. To make you live longer and have more opportunities at the end of it so there is a certain elegance to the all thing, so in terms of … The first point you mentioned I wouldn’t … I think the ethical problem isn’t one that is immediately connected to money or the price of something. We are talking about allocations effort so it’s a little bit more than money. It&#x27;s who has an opportunity to have access to certain technologies and it’s not just the money that is the problem. I mean an interesting exercise for you would be for example to make the list of countries in the world in terms of poverty for example or wealth and take the top ten countries, the middle ten countries from that and the bottom ten countries of that and then see where cryo technologies are actually offered. I don’t know the answer to that question but I would bet money that there are cryopreservation services available at the top and probably not so much in the middle and none in the bottom. So even if you have a ton of cash, if you live in a certain part of the world you will not be able to access it there, and even if you do a purchase power adjusted for the cost of these things even then you wouldn’t incentivize someone opening a cryopreservation facility I don’t know where in a threshold country somewhere of the allocation problem you already have somewhere and so you just have a minor image of the problem we already have in biotechnologies right? In terms of cryonics technologies and climate change. It may be the case that we will get to the point anyway where that rate will drop dramatically because of the way the world is developing. And then we make it to a point at some stage where we have to imagine ways to preserve ourselves and for the future my guess is it’s more likely to be something at the start of life than at the end of life. I think that the focus will be more on fine tuning the assisting reproduction technologies. And creating new individuals may be completely in exogenesis without actually a pregnant person to be a part of this. Rather than preserving people at the end of life. I think longevity projects are going  to look at giving us a significant longer life span and modern medicine will already achieve that. And wealth in certain countries of the world will already achieve that and not in others. So we already have people living to 80 or 85 in developed countries and a significantly lower life expectancy in other parts of the world. So that’s already happening in a sense but I don’t think that we are going to get way beyond a 100 in some countries and maybe that’s not a good thing to go way beyond a 100 so we are going to focus mainly on the start of life and we suddenly have hundreds of thousands of people who need to be super chilled in facilities across the global north I don’t think it is going to be particularly climate friendly either hum I think these are technologies that suck up an enormous amount of energy and create a massive carbon footprint for what is a funeral parlor. And I find this very difficult to justify in a generation equity sense. </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : It’s also an issue to say that today with the stakes that we … that there are around the climate question it would be selfish to do so or just use a ton of energy for something that will never work. Because there is also … just before we end, maybe we have two more questions if it’s okay with you. And the first one is related to the case we mentioned about the young girl who was cryopreserved. How do you think this case impacts the perception of cryonics in the world because it seems like a very important milestone or an important moment in the cryonics world. How did it change the perception of cryonics? And it’s also because when we found you this first time it was in this <em>Guardian</em> article and many <em>Guardian</em> articles were written about this issue. </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : In terms of perception of cryonics I think from the perspective of those who are offering cryonics as a service I think the reporting of this case and that this case happened at all was probably positive in the sense that it further makes the whole thing relatable (45’55). I think it created in the public perception that there is a young girl who didn’t get a fair chance at life and all she’s trying to do is have an opportunity later on and most people who won’t have a heart of stone will say let her, this is important to her and why not and the mother is in favor as well … Of course it is just a legal technicality while she couldn’t decide on her own. And because she wasn’t 18, she had to have her parents to agree to do this and her father, who hadn’t been around anyway disagreed for whatever reason. So that is why the Court got involved. In terms of the public perception I think there is a very positive spin to this. And it certainly didn’t bring the whole thing to the public debate for a while. In terms of the legal conversation around it that has not really been a talking point because in legal terms it hasn’t really been exciting. It really boiled down only to the question of who took the decision in what circumstances onto a really boring technicality saying in normal circumstances of the system of law the court would not be asked to decide this until the problem had actually occurred. So normally, under normal circumstances we would have to wait for JS to die and then the disagreement between mother and father happens and then the mother can apply to the court and then the court can decide and would have probably decided to state in favor of the mother. But that would have meant a huge amount of time between the death and the Court decision. So much time in fact that it would have frustrated cryopreservation. So the Court was asked to unusually state a problem that happened before. It is very unusual that given these circumstances the court was happy to take that decision before the problem had actually occurred. That is the only legal problem that has really happened. And that is why legally speaking it is not very interesting. Morally speaking it was interesting to basically start discussion about what people should be allowed to do after death. What is the body after death? Is it something where you still have to respect an individual’s wishes because it is something that you have to treat that body with respect and dignity does that mean respecting their wishes and permitting cryopreservation or does that idea of becoming an objective standard rather than a subjective standard means we don’t let people do strange stuff with the body and I think one thing in public perception didn’t play a role after this which is a very unfortunate … is how did the story worked out in the end? I don’t think it was talked about much but it actually didn’t work very well. If you found the judgment of the JS case online … </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : How did you say the judgment was? Because we did not find the name of the girl …</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : It should be online … let me multitask for a second … Here is the judgment … in paragraph 66 or 67 it is like a postscript that the judge added after the all thing was over.It gives you a glimpse of how it actually worked out in the end. The answer is it did not work out very well. The ones who collected JS’s body were amateurs, they did not know what they were doing, they had the wrong car, the body wouldn’t fit in the car. So they were there with the body and they had to a car rental company, rent a van quickly and it was all very ad-hoc and they arrived with the van and they blocked the emergency entrance of the hospital and they forced the people in the hospital, nurses and doctors to help them and the nurses and doctors were not really happy about it. And it is just amateurish and problematic. </div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Léa : If I remember well it’s … it was Alcor taking care of this case so it sounds weird to hear they were amateur since Alcor is the most famous and important cryopreservation agency.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : But the people from Kentucky or Colorado they don’t get on the plane to go to London, to sit outside a hospital to wait for a young girl to die. The way it works is they have volunteers in different cities around the world and these volunteers are activated when someone wants to be cryopreserved.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Léa : Okay.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : It doesn’t happen very often, and if you are a volunteer in London or somewhere, and you are well trained and all that in theory but it doesn’t happen so often that you get a call and someone says that’s time, come on and then you go to a hospital in the middle of the night and if you’ve never done it before in an actual setting you are probably surrounded by relatively best case skeptical, worst case hostile medical professionals who have just spent weeks fighting for the life of a young girl, and then palliative cares for the young girl and actually knew her when she was alive and you come out of nowhere, you’ve never known the girl and you suddenly want to have her body, you suddenly want to do things to her body in the hospital and it is all very unusual. I think the setting wasn’t really particularly useful and they probably need more routine. But it’s simply the case that they came with the wrong car. And the body wouldn’t fit in the car! It gives you an indication that this was a particularly professional thing. But it played no role in the public debate afterwards. Because the debate was over! The debate happened while JS was alive and while the Court heard her case. And while she could still be a part of … that’s great that JS was a part of the conversation and when she actually died, there were one or two newspapers articles that said that has happened now and the cryopreservation took place but there was no article or heated public debate on whether it turned out to be a good or a bad exercise. This is maybe something we can generalize. Not just for cryopreservation but for health and technologies and society in general. We are not very good when it comes to learning lessons from what actually works or not. We will at some point I hope come out of this pandemic and we will be really bad at learning lessons from it. And when the next pandemic will come, we will be back to square 1 [...] (53’27 - 54’04)</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Léa : Just to come back to the JS case and if it didn’t work in the end.

I think there is a reasonable intuition that it wasn’t good for the body. These are not ideal circumstances to set her up for something that happens or doesn’t happen in the future. And it may be worse … I don’t know if you will be speaking to a medical professional who knows about cryopreservation and who understands what happens when you cryogenized a part of the body that a long delay at the donation stage means that there might be irreversible necrosis of for example tissues and stuff like that. I am not the right expert for that but I am very skeptical.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : Okay maybe one last question about the body and you mentioned the body what is somebody’s body? And “what is a body?” is already a difficult question and I think that is a question that you encountered and that you worked on. So what is a body? How could cryopreservation change the way we see a body, we conceive a body? It’s more philosophical and it is also very ethical in a way, in ourself, how do we consider ourself, our body? So what is a body and what is a body going to become with cryonics maybe in the future?</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Nils Hoppe : Yes that’s a very exciting and interesting question and it’s also a really difficult question right at the end of something because in a way it’s hum it underpins all of this. And it is probably a good question for a cultural anthropologist rather than a philosopher lawyer. So the law is boring. And it depends where you are but the only exciting legal aspect is hum more about the personality rights like dignity like they survive like this for a certain time … Philosophically speaking what is the body is an interesting question and one we can’t answer yet hum but from a cultural perspective that is where it comes to be interesting. In my point of view. If somebody dies in a conventional way, they become an ex-person. They are no longer a person, they are no longer a citizen. They are no longer holders of many rights. They are few rights that are still attached to the shell that is available but it is less and less and for me we are in a liminal space, The liminal space is something where you are in between two spaces between having just lost someone the person that we had a personal connection to, that we loved, that was there for us as an individual and the point where we let go, where we say this person is gone. And we have put him in the incinerator or in the ground and we can say goodbye and it is heavily ritualized. You know funerals aren’t for the dead, they are for the living. They are for us, they are for us to say goodbye to the people, they are for us to have a memory that closes the door to have a memory with that person and allows us to move on. And to answer your question to give you at least an extra question or ten in relation to your question cryopreservation forgets that it doesn’t do that it leaves you forever in that liminal space, in that space in between you never come out of it because you never really say goodbye and for some people that might be a really positive thing in the sense that they don’t have to say goodbye and I like your example of the 2-year-old child in Philippines. I mean I have two small children. I cannot imagine a world without them and it would absolutely break my heart if one of them was no longer there. And if somebody offered me an opportunity to not have to say goodbye forever but to preserve something whatever it is, I would probably take that and that’s why parents or people that are directly affected are the worst people to take these types of decision socially and in society. It has to be unaffected people who should think this through to the end. As soon as I start thinking about this in terms of my own children I am no longer capable of taking emotionally detached decisions. So for some people it is positive to be in the state of liminality but for other people it would be a never ending horror and an inability to let go. A constant attachedness to people who are dead and who will probably not come back, at least not in my life. It forgets the fact that we have to say goodbye to people and let them go. I think that is massively problematic. And if we say at some point cryopreservation works and we can solve all the problems of equality of access, allocation of access, social problems, problems with too many people being around, problem with old people being around. If we can solve all the problems that we have talked about we also need to solve the problem how do we say goodbye to people? Because not everyone will be cryopreserved some people will die because of an accident or because of wars or … And we won’t be able to cryopreserve them and we’ll have two classes of deaths at that point. And I have no idea what that means for society but it is going to be a massive challenge to find ways to deal with that culturally. I’m sorry it didn’t really answer your question.</div><div class="content-p " id="0d700797-08b8-47d3-8f82-876b5b54c69e">Matéo : No no it’s great thank you very much.
